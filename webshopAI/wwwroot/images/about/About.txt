🪐 About Nebula Space Parts Inc.

Founded in 2261, Nebula Space Parts Inc. began as a small interstellar workshop orbiting the trade moon Zyrath-9, right as the spacecraft renaissance reshaped the galaxy. What started as a handful of engineers repairing freighters in microgravity soon grew into the galaxy’s most trusted supplier of premium-grade spacecraft components.

At the heart of Nebula’s success is Glork, its visionary CEO from the planet Galak, nestled deep within the Crab Nebula. Known for his calm presence and meticulous craftsmanship, Glork transformed Nebula Space Parts from a frontier venture into a corporate powerhouse. His belief is simple: “Precision is the bridge between survival and stardust.”

Nebula’s parts now fuel trade routes across every known sector — from the Core Systems to the Outer Colonies — ensuring that freighters, exploration cruisers, and defense fleets alike reach their destinations safely. Each component, from the Quantum Flux Drive MK-VII to the Solar Sail Energy Collector, carries the same signature quality that has defined the Nebula brand for centuries.

And in every docking bay, captains and engineers alike echo the same advice:

“If it’s from Glork… you can trust it to bring you home.”
